# Cliferay

```
cliferay

  Daily scripts to work with Liferay
  
  The scripts can be run from any folder:
    - If the folder is outside the repo it will use LIFERAY_HOME.
    - If the folder is inside the repo it will use that repo. 
    
  For example every day I open my terminal and type:
  
    > cliferay morning
  
  and it will just work no matter which folder I am in.
